# Multilayer Perceptron

`Dataset Used`: EMNIST Dataset

## Topics Covered:

1. Multilayer Perceptron Model Building and Training
2. Introduce Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization Strategy for better model convergence
3. Introduce Dropout
4. Manual Backpropagation through all the layers. [Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization]
5. Also used Pytorch built-in functionality to perform all these above mentioned works.
